/** A two-way socket useful for unit testing

    An instance of this class simulates a traditional socket,
    while also providing features useful for unit testing.
    Each endpoint maintains an independent buffer called
    the input area. Writes from one endpoint append data
    to the peer's pending input area. When an endpoint performs
    a read and data is present in the input area, the data is
    delivered to the blocking or asynchronous operation. Otherwise
    the operation is blocked or deferred until data is made
    available, or until the endpoints become disconnected.

    These streams may be used anywhere an algorithm accepts a
    reference to a synchronous or asynchronous read or write
    stream. It is possible to use a test stream in a call to
    `net::read_until`, or in a call to
    @ref boost::beast::http::async_write for example.

    As with Boost.Asio I/O objects, a @ref stream constructs
    with a reference to the `net::io_context` to use for
    handling asynchronous I/O. For asynchronous operations, the
    stream follows the same rules as a traditional asio socket
    with respect to how completion handlers for asynchronous
    operations are performed.

    To facilitate testing, these streams support some additional
    features:

    @li The input area, represented by a @ref beast::basic_flat_buffer,
    may be directly accessed by the caller to inspect the contents
    before or after the remote endpoint writes data. This allows
    a unit test to verify that the received data matches.

    @li Data may be manually appended to the input area. This data
    will delivered in the next call to
    @ref stream::read_some or @ref stream::async_read_some.
    This allows predefined test vectors to be set up for testing
    read algorithms.

    @li The stream may be constructed with a fail count. The
    stream will eventually fail with a predefined error after a
    certain number of operations, where the number of operations
    is controlled by the test. When a test loops over a range of
    operation counts, it is possible to exercise every possible
    point of failure in the algorithm being tested. When used
    correctly the technique allows the tests to reach a high
    percentage of code coverage.

    @par Thread Safety
        @e Distinct @e objects: Safe.@n
        @e Shared @e objects: Unsafe.
        The application must also ensure that all asynchronous
        operations are performed within the same implicit or explicit strand.
